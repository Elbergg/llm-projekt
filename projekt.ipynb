        "BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) evaluates how closely a model-generated text matches a reference text, based on n-gram matching. Commonly used for machine translation, BLEU measures how well words or sequences of words (n-grams) in the generated text align with the reference text.\n",
        "\n",
        "n-gram Precision: BLEU checks more than just individual word matches, looking at sequences of two or more words (n-grams). For example, 1-gram measures single word accuracy, while 2-gram captures two-word sequences.\n",
        "Brevity Penalty: To avoid rewarding overly short responses, BLEU includes a penalty for sentences that are too brief. This ensures that short texts don’t artificially inflate their scores by matching only the most common words.\n",
        "BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with scores closer to 1 indicating a high similarity with the reference text. It is especially reliable when multiple reference texts are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE: Optimized for Summarization\n",
        "ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) was developed to measure summarization accuracy, focusing on how well the generated text captures essential content from the reference text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The metric offers several variations:\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE-N: Measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference texts. ROUGE-1 (single-word matches) and ROUGE-2 (two-word matches) are commonly used.\n",
        "ROUGE-L: Focuses on the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the generated and reference texts, which preserves the sentence structure and improves coherence.\n",
        "ROUGE-W: A weighted version of ROUGE-L, emphasizing longer matching sequences to give more accurate results in summarization.\n",
        "ROUGE is particularly effective for evaluating summaries, as it checks whether the generated text captures key information.\n",
